# Basic Storyboard
The basic design will be heavily based on the previous design done for the unit. This is due to it already being fully functional and only needing minimal changes to make it relevant to the portfolio. The second benefit is that it will drastically drop the work load down by over 50%.

# Basic Colour Scheme
The default colours which were used for Unit 13 will also be used here due to it adding some vibrancy to the website while not being to intense on the eyes. (Colours also match with the original website design.)
