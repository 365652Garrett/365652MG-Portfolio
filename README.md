# Description of task
Design a digital portfolio aimed towards current or future employers to show them my skill set, hobbies and general info about me.

# Developers/Me
+ Must be clear, easy to read.
+ Eye catching towards the employer.

# Employer
+ Must be able to clearly see/read about my hobbies, qualifications, contact info, etc.
+ Must show off my skills 

# Basic Storyboard
The basic design will be heavily based on the previous design done for the unit. This is due to it already being fully functional and only needing minimal changes to make it relevant to the portfolio. The second benefit is that it will drastically drop the work load down by over 50%.
